This is Alex request: 
<request>

This is the feedback the robot gave trying to execute the last plan:
<feedback>

This is the list of actions performed by the robot up to now:
<cmdHistory>

This is the current JSON environment state:
<state>

While describing the remaining action to fullfill the human request, 
check the list of actions performed by the robot up to now
and do not replicate actions that where already done but instead give the 
list of actions that are still necessary to fullfill the goal.
